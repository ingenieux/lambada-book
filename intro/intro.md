## Requirements

This book supposes you already know:

  * Java
  * Maven
  * Git
  * JSON and its parsing (specially using Jackson)

We recommend - but it is not critical - to know basic AWS usage including:

  * [awscli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) (and its brother, [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/))
  * Basic AWS Services, such as S3
  * Basic usage of the [AWS SDK for Java](http://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/)

## The Vision

Lambada (the tool) was built on your experience writing [beanstalker](https://beanstalker.ingenieux.com.br/beanstalk-maven-plugin/), as well as the [AWS SDK for TypeScript](https://github.com/ingenieux/aws-sdk-typescript/). Its philosophy can summed as:

  * Allow as much flexibility as possible first, and later composing functionality
  * Properties over XML Files
  * Defaults where possible, or move it into a parent pom file.
  * Cognito over AWS API Gateway for Serverless Apps
  * TypeScript over JavaScript (when needed)

## Getting in Touch

Feel free to make any comments on [gitter](https://gitter.im/ingenieux/lambada/) or if you're shy, [just e-mail me](mailto:aldrin@leal.eng.br)

I believe its enough. Lets iterate from here. :)
